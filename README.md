Monster Typer
-------------

## Overview 

The problem we set out to face is to encourage typing and increase productivity. This is a game loosely inspired by monster training games. The aplication records keystrokes, and checks if they are words, then reward points to the player according to word size. Have a fun growing a monster while you work. This will Hopefully increase your incentive to type. 

## Use

The home page shows your monster and the current level which you are on. 
You also have the option to click on your monster to increase its friendship with you.
The stats page gives you a detailed report of your monsters stats which include:
* Monster Name 
* XP (experience points) 
* HP (health points)
* Features like personality and relationship status
* Battles won


The fight page is not yet completed but will be completed soon.

Keys are checked automatically wherever you type. This could be a google search, a word document, or even a discord message for example. 
This means that there is no need to have the GUI displayed on screen while you type. It is intended that the application be minimized while you are typing creating less distraction.
